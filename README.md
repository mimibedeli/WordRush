# WordRush
WordRush is a fast-paced, interactive terminal-based word game where players form real words using a random selection of 8 letters. The game includes power-ups, score tracking, multiplayer support, and time-based challenges to make gameplay fun and competitive.

# How to Play
1. When the game starts, choose from three modes: Solo, Versus Computer, or Multiplayer (2–4 players).

2. You’ll receive 8 random letters to form as many valid English words as possible in 60 seconds.

3. Optional power-ups may appear at the start of a round:
   - **Wildcard** – Add or remove a letter from your set.
   - **Extra Time** – Extends the round to 70 seconds.
   - **Double Points** – Doubles your total score at the end of the round.

4. Type `quit` at any time to end the round early.

5. Points are awarded based on word length, with bonuses for using all 8 letters.
